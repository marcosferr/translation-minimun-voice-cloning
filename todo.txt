[3/6] Selecting best voice segments with gpt-5-mini...
      Selected segments: [0, 1]
      Reason: Segments 0 (3.2s) and 1 (2.3s) give a combined ~5.5s of clear, natural speech with complete/usable phrases. Segment 0 is a clean, representative full-sentence intro (“So now let's talk about Amazon GuardDuty…”), and Segment 1 provides a distinct prosodic pattern (“Number one, you can have a multi-account strategy…”) useful for capturing the speaker’s cadence and emphasis. Other segments are more truncated/repetitive or shorter and less complete, so they are less useful for cloning.
